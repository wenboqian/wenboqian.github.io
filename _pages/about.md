# About Me

I am a research assistant working with [Prof. Chang Lou](https://changlousys.github.io/) of LiftLab at **University of Virginia**. Fortunately, I am also advised by [Dr. Zhen Zhang](https://zarzen.me/), **Johns Hopkins University**, [Dr. Yuan Zhou](https://zhouyuan1119.github.io/), **Cornell University**, and [Dr. Shaowei Zhu](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~shaoweiz/), **Princeton University**.

My research interests are primarily on improving the reliability and efficiency of distributed systems. One focus is to detect and localize silent errors in real-world cloud and ML systems.

For the past year, I've working in providing reliability support for machine learning developers, inspired by observations made from our collaborating team in **AWS**.

From 2021 to 2023, I worked at **Alibaba Group** as a full-time software engineer in Guangzhou, China, undertaking objectives of enhancing quality and efficiency while empowering internal teams.
